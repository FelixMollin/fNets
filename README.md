# Neural Network package to consecutively add data to the Model 

This project is here to create powerful Neural Networks when not much data can 
be provided at the moment, but more data can be provided in the future. 
Like in quantative trading where every new trade can be crucial data to be added 
to your training dataset. 

* Create easy to understand Neural Networks
* Create simple Neural Networks to be run on small devices
* Perpetually integrate new training data
* NeuralNetwork "CI/CD"
* easy Network scaling
